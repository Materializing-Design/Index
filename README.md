An Index of MDM Archives 

The Method for Design Materialization (MDM) is a research method leveraging design documentation, reflective journaling, grounded theory analysis, and game analysis for transparent and stronger game design research.

For a repo to be considered ready for analysis, it needs to have:
1. A reflective journal
2. Playable builds of the game on various stages.
3. Reflective git commits

These three components surface the tacit knowledge and design decisions embedded in a research-creation project,
